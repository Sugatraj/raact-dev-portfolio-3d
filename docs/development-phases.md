  ```
  src/
  ├── components/
  │   ├── canvas/     # 3D components
  │   ├── layout/     # Layout components
  │   └── ui/         # UI components
  ├── sections/       # Main sections of the portfolio
  ├── assets/         # Static assets and 3D models

- [ ] Accessibility testing
- [ ] SEO optimization

## Phase 7: Deployment and Documentation
**Duration: 1-2 days**
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Deploy to hosting platform
- [ ] Create documentation:
  - [ ] Setup instructions
  - [ ] Development guidelines
  - [ ] Performance notes
- [ ] Add README and contributing guidelines

## Optional Enhancements (Post-Launch)
**Duration: Ongoing**
- [ ] Blog section with 3D elements
- [ ] Dark/Light theme toggle
- [ ] Multiple language support
- [ ] Custom 404 page with 3D scene
- [ ] Analytics integration
- [ ] Newsletter subscription
